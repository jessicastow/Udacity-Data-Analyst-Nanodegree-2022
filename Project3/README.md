# Project 3: Ford GoBike System
This is the folder for Project 3 as part of the requirements for Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree.

### Project Aims
The aim of this project is to produce visualisations through exploratory data analysis and visualisation.

### Project Introduction
This dataset includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system 'Ford GoBike' covering the greater San Francisco Bay area for 2019.

- In Part I, Exploratory data visualization, Python visualization libraries were used to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables.
- In Part II, Explanatory data visualization, a short presentation was produced that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that you discovered in your selected dataset. 

This project was completed using Jupyter Notebook. The following packages (libraries) were also installed and used for this project: pandas, NumPy, seaborn and matplotlib.
