# Project 2: WeRateDogs Twitter Archive

This is the folder for Project 2 as part of the requirements for Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree. 

The goal of this project was to wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. We used three sources of data and combining them into one dataset.

The Jupyter notebook for the project can be viewed in the [wrangle_act.pybn](https://github.com/jessicastow/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree-2022/blob/main/Project2/wrangle_act.ipynb) file. 

The data sources used for this project include: [image-predictions.tsv](https://github.com/jessicastow/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree-2022/blob/main/Project2/image-predictions.tsv), [tweet-json.txt](https://github.com/jessicastow/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree-2022/blob/main/Project2/tweet-json.txt) and [twitter-archive-enhanced](https://github.com/jessicastow/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree-2022/blob/main/Project2/twitter-archive-enhanced.csv). All three of these data sources have been combined into one csv file named: [twitter_archive_master.csv](https://github.com/jessicastow/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree-2022/blob/main/Project2/twitter_archive_master.csv)

All the insights are communicated and visualisations produced from the wrangled data are displayed in a single pdf file [act_report.pdf](https://github.com/jessicastow/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree-2022/blob/main/Project2/act_report.pdf) which cannot be viewed directly on github.com, and therefore needs to be downloaded to be viewed. 

A [wrangle_report.pdf](https://github.com/jessicastow/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree-2022/blob/main/Project2/wrangle_report.pdf) has been included that briefly describes my wrangling efforts. This also needs to be downloaded to be viewed.

Any further queries about the project can be sent to me and I'd be happy to explain my methods ðŸ˜Š.
