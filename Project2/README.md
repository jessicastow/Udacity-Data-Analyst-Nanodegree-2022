This is the folder for Project 2 for Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree. 

The Jupyter notebook for the project can be viewed in the [wrangle_act.pybn](https://github.com/jessicastow/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree-2022/blob/main/Project2/wrangle_act.ipynb) file. 

The data sources used for this project include: [image-predictions.tsv](https://github.com/jessicastow/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree-2022/blob/main/Project2/image-predictions.tsv), [tweet-json.txt](https://github.com/jessicastow/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree-2022/blob/main/Project2/tweet-json.txt) and [twitter-archive-enhanced](https://github.com/jessicastow/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree-2022/blob/main/Project2/twitter-archive-enhanced.csv).

The report, data visualisation and insights are contained in a single pdf file [act_report.pdf](https://github.com/jessicastow/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree-2022/blob/main/Project2/act_report.pdf) which cannot be viewed directly on github.com, and therefore needs to be downloaded.
