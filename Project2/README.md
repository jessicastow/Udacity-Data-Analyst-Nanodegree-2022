# Project 2: WeRateDogs Twitter Archive

This is the folder for Project 2 as part of the requirements for Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree. 

### Project Aims
The goal of this project was to wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. We used three sources of data and combining them into one dataset.

### Project Introduction
The dataset that we wrangled (and analyzed and visualised) was the tweet archive of Twitter user [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates), also known as [WeRateDogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeRateDogs). WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for us to use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017.

This project was completed using Jupyter Notebook. 
The following packages (libraries) were also installed and used for this project: pandas, NumPy, requests, tweepy, matplotlib and json. 


### Files in this repository
The Jupyter notebook for the project can be viewed in the [wrangle_act.ipynb](https://github.com/jessicastow/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree-2022/blob/main/Project2/wrangle_act.ipynb) file. 

The data sources used for this project include: [image-predictions.tsv](https://github.com/jessicastow/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree-2022/blob/main/Project2/image-predictions.tsv), [tweet-json.txt](https://github.com/jessicastow/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree-2022/blob/main/Project2/tweet-json.txt) and [twitter-archive-enhanced](https://github.com/jessicastow/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree-2022/blob/main/Project2/twitter-archive-enhanced.csv). All three of these data sources have been combined into one csv file named: [twitter_archive_master.csv](https://github.com/jessicastow/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree-2022/blob/main/Project2/twitter_archive_master.csv)

All the insights are communicated and visualisations produced from the wrangled data are displayed in a single pdf file [act_report.pdf](https://github.com/jessicastow/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree-2022/blob/main/Project2/act_report.pdf) which cannot be viewed directly on github.com, and therefore needs to be downloaded to be viewed. 

A [wrangle_report.pdf](https://github.com/jessicastow/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree-2022/blob/main/Project2/wrangle_report.pdf) has been included that briefly describes my wrangling efforts. This also needs to be downloaded to be viewed.

Any further queries about the project can be sent to me and I'd be happy to explain my methods ðŸ˜Š.
