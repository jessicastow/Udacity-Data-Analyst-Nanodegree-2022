# Project 1: No show appointments
This is the folder for Project 1 as part of the requirements for Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree.

### Project Aims
The aim of this project was to determine what factors are important for us to know in order for us to predict if a patient will show up to their scheduled appointment.

### Project Introduction
- This project was completed using Jupyter Notebook. 
- The following packages (libraries) were also installed and used for this project: pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
- This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.
- The data set was taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments).
